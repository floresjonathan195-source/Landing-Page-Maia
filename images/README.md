# Images Directory

This directory is intended to store image assets for the Maia Kode Genesis project.

## Purpose

The landing page references images that should be stored in this directory:
- `Maia Kode.png` - Avatar for Maia Kode
- `Jon Efe.jpeg` - Photo of Jon Efe (co-creator)

## Usage

When adding new images to this project:
1. Place image files directly in this `/images` directory
2. Reference them in HTML using the path `images/filename.ext`
3. Ensure images are optimized for web use

## Note

This directory structure must be maintained for the proper functioning of the landing page, even when no image files are present.
